To compile and install the CPSP package and its dependencies just run the 
 ./CPSP_compileAndInstall.sh 
bash shell script. 

The script will also unpack and install various H-cores for 3D cubic lattice.

NOTE: 
You have to adapt the pathes in the script if you dont want to install 
the package and H-cores into subfolders of your home directory! 
This was set to avoid the need for root privileges for the installation process.

In case of questions or problems dont hesitate to contact me
